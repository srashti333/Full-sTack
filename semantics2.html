            <h1>What is GNU?</h1>
            <p>GNU is an operating system that is free software—that is, it respects users' freedom. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages (programs specifically released by the GNU Project) as well as free software released by third parties. The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We recommend installable versions of GNU (more precisely, GNU/Linux distributions) which are entirely free software. More about GNU below.</p>

            <h1>What is Free software?</h1>
            <p> <b>Free software means the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.</b> </p>
            <br>
            <p>Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech”, not as in “free beer”.</p>
            <p>More precisely, free software means users of a program have the four essential freedoms:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li><br>
                    <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
                    <br><li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).</li>
                    <br><li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Developments in technology and network use have made these freedoms even more important now than they were in 1983.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Nowadays the free software movement goes far beyond developing the GNU system. See the Free Software Foundation's web site for more about what we do, and a list of ways you can help.</p>

            <h1>More about GNU</h1>
            <p>GNU is a Unix-like operating system. That means it is a collection of many programs: applications, libraries, developer tools, even games. The development of GNU, started in January 1984, is known as the GNU Project. Many of the programs in GNU are released under the auspices of the GNU Project; those we call GNU packages.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The name “GNU” is a recursive acronym for “GNU's Not Unix.” “GNU” is pronounced g'noo, as one syllable, like saying “grew” but replacing the r with n.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The program in a Unix-like system that allocates machine resources and talks to the hardware is called the “kernel”. GNU is typically used with a kernel called Linux. This combination is the GNU/Linux operating system. GNU/Linux is used by millions, though many call it “Linux” by mistake.</p>
            <br>
            <p>GNU's own kernel, the GNU Hurd, was started in 1990 (before Linux was started). Volunteers continue developing the Hurd because it is an interesting technical project.</p>

            Vc-dwim
            The vc-dwim package contains two tools, vc-dwim and vc-chlog. vc-dwim is a tool that simplifies the task of maintaining a ChangeLog and using version control at the same time, for example by printing a reminder when a file change has been described in the ChangeLog but the file has not been added to the VC. vc-chlog scans changed files and generates standards-compliant ChangeLog entries based on the changes that it detects.
